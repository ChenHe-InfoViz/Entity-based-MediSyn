# MediSyn: Synthesizing cancer treatment biomarkers from multiple sources with entity-based interactions for insight discovery and sharing
1) selecting entities of interest, 
2) connecting relevant entities, 
3) elaborating by retrieving the details of entity relations, 
4) exploring other entities, 
5) entity-based insight sharing.

It is a Node.js web application using Express framework and MongoDB for data storage; D3.js was used to create the interactive visualization.

This version supports insight sharing; a earlier version without insight sharing at https://github.com/ChenHe-InfoViz/MediSyn
